<h1 class="journal-title">Git and Github</h1>

<h2 class="journal-header">What is Git?</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Git is a source control solution. Git manages changes that are made to a project, and allows the user to return to older verisons of the code.</p>

<h2 class="journal-header">Branches</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Branches in git are useful because they allow developers to work and update a project for testing without having to use the code from the main branch.</p>

<h2 class="journal-header">Git vs GitHub</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Git is seperate from GitHub, git is the source control solution. GitHub provides hosting for coding projects and allows the usage of git as the source controller.</p>

<h2 class="journal-header">Pseudo-Classes</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Pseudo classes are used to select an element when its in a certain state. Common pseudo classes would be hover and link.</p>

<h2 class="journal-header">Specificity</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Specificity is what CSS uses to determine which effect should be applied to an element when it is targeted by 2 different properties. It allows you to target many elements with broader selectors and then change them at a closer level by being specific with the selector.</p>

<h2 class="journal-header">!important</h2>

<p class="journal-text">The !important property overrides any specificity from all linked stylesheets. You can run into issues using it if there is more than 1 !important property applied to an element. Using it is typically bad practice.</p>

<h1 class="journal-title">Cheating at Design</h1>

<h2 class="journal-header">A good tip to improve your design.</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Using accent borders with a bit of color was my favorite design tip from the blog. It's a very simple thing to add but it makes your page much more interesting to look at.</p>

<h2 class="journal-header">These websites have great designs:</h2>

<h2 class="journal-header">The influence of good design.</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Good design makes your website easier to use. Good design looks intuative and features should require as little explanation as possible. Through design you can convey the purpose of your site easily, like if it is a store or a place to chat with people.</p>

<h1 class="journal-title">Wire-Framing</h1>

<h2 class="journal-header">What is the purpose of wire-framing?</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Wire-framing is used to develop a layout of a website before writing any actual code. Wire-frames are quick and cheap to make.</p>

<h2 class="journal-header">What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Wireframes can have multiple levels of detail, from pen and paper to using special design software to wireframe. Each level is useful for visualization of the site and gets more accurate to the final design.</p>

<h2 class="journal-header">Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?</h2>

<p class="journal-text">Absolutely, they are relatively quick to make and let clients see the product before time and resources go into developing code for the site.</p>
